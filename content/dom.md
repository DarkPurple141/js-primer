# What the DOM?

The Document Object Model or colloquially (DOM) provides the interface that allows
JavaScript to interact with XML, SVG and HTML through the browser.

## The DOM APIs

We call the webpage a Document, and the DOM allows the Document to be broken up into
a manipulatable tree-like structure that allows more complex usage of an otherwise
static page. JavaScript, aided by the DOM brings a webpage to life.
