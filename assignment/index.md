# Ideas

* Instagram!
   - Has lots of potential JavaScript components
   - Infinite scroll
   - Fetch/AJAX
   - Swipe maybe?
   - Ability to like, unlike a post
   - Ability to get push notifications via AJAX polling
* Create React / VDOM
* Fetch Data from a public API and display it
* Create an API which app has to fetch -> render -> refetch -> re-render
* Drag and Drop based game (Mouse or Touch API)
* Infinite scroll blog (async requests, DOM check scroll)
* Basic animations
* WebWorkers?
