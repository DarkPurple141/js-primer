# Ideas

* Create React
* Fetch Data from a public API and display it
* Create an API which app has to fetch -> render -> refetch -> re-render
* Drag and Drop based game (Mouse or Touch API)
* Card or slidedeck -- maybe something along the lines of instagram
* Infinite scroll blog (async requests, DOM check scroll)
* Basic animations
* WebWorkers?
